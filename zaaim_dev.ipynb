    "\n",
    "## SCAN TYPES\n",
    "\n",
    "The data given is a single brain with various different types of MRI scans done on it to portray different information about the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T1\n",
    "\n",
    "This scan is a basic MRI which takes into account all the general signals the MRI can detect. This causes the image to be a little fuzzy due to the fluid motion in the brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### T2\n",
    "\n",
    "This scan focuses on the fluid regions of the brains by scanning in a manner which makes them much brighter in comparison to the brain matter areas. These scans help identify edema or inflammation in the brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Edema is when too much fluid is trapped in the body tissue\n",
    "\n",
    "### FRAIR\n",
    "\n",
    "This scan focuses on the brain matter, muscle tissue, and solid regions of the brain to identify physical deformations such as tumors or lesions. (What are MS Plaques)\n",
    "\n",
    "### T1CE\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is applied to make areas of blood-brain barrier disruptors more apparent so that region of tumors and inflammation appear more bright. (Do not fully understand yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "### SEGMENTATION\n",
    "\n",
    "This are labeled regions of the brain that have been identified/segmented for analysis due to abnormalities observed during the scan. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These were most likely used as training data for a model to identify the points where abnormalities occured in the brain so that more subtle abnormalities could be detected??????????** \n",
    "\n",
    "**For out purposes of brain slice generation, would this be helpful???**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whenever I set slice_idx=0 the animation does not update the data based on the frame (I need to find out why)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. My code still outputs blank images after execution, I believe it is due to the animation module finishing; however, I am not sure. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. NamesTempFile argument delete must be set to False on Windows machines (Noted for future reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Other\n",
    "\n",
    "- .nii: NeuroImaging Informatics\n",
    "- Data is stored in memory, written to disk, then reread from disk into memory\n",
    "- Takes a **FAT** minute to load\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Sprint 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "- I first attempted to cut out the disk processing portion used to handle the .nii files. \n",
    "- This did not work out since nibabel does not work with the BytesIO class and must be stored on disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I was able to complete uploading to AWS the processed information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edited the upload program to take into account past uploads being completed"
